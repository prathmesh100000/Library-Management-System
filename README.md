Library Management System using Python
- This project simulates a simple Library Management System using Python, where students can browse, 
add, and remove books from their cart. It maintains a list of books with details like name, author, price, 
and ISBN. 
- Students can register by providing their personal information and interact with the library system to 
manage their book selections.
